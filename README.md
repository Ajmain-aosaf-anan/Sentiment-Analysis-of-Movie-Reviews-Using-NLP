# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews-Using-NLP

- Developed a sentiment analysis model using an IMDB dataset of 50,000 movie reviews
- Implemented data preprocessing with BeautifulSoup, NLTK, and scikit-learn
- Utilized TF-IDF vectorization and trained Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM models
- Achieved up to 91.76% accuracy with traditional models
- Incorporated an RNN model with LSTM layers using TensorFlow
- Evaluated the RNN model with a 5-epoch training cycle
- Saved the model as "rnn_model.h5" for future use
- Set up a virtual environment and installed key libraries (seaborn, nltk, scikit-learn, wordcloud, bs4, spacy, tensorflow)
- Loaded and cleaned the IMDB dataset using BeautifulSoup and regex
- Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE
- Developed an LSTM-based deep learning model with TensorFlow, achieving improved performance after 5 epochs
